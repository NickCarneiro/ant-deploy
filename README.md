==========

The RTS game of arthropod conquest

Guide your ants to victory.

##Classes
*Queen*

Protect her at all costs. If she dies, you lose. She is the source of all other ants.


*Scout*

There are very few tunnels when the game begins. You start with one ant of each class in a main chamber. A fog-of-war prevents you from seeing your opponents base. Scouts can dig quickly and communicate enemy positions through the hive mind.


*Builder*

Builders can construct fortifications that take a very long time to dig through. They can also build poison zones that sap the health of ants in the immediate vicinity.


*Soldier*

All ants can attack, but soldiers do the most damage and start with the highest health.
